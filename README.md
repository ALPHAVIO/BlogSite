    - Recommended-
        - [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
        - [Download Atom](https://atom.io/)
<br/>

* Download [Node Js and npm(Node package manager)](https://nodejs.org/en/) (when you download Node, npm also gets installed by default)
<br/>

* Mongo DB community editition is free and a great software in order to work with MongoDB applications. [Download Mongo DB community editition](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)
<br/>

* Robo 3T is a desktop graphical user interface (GUI) for Mongo DB. It can help to skip running all the Mongo DB commands manually every time we want to access the data. [Download Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/download) **(optional)**
